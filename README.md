# Stormy18
An app created by following the Build a Weather App course (2018 version) on teamtreehouse.com

This project uses a private API key from darksky.net. It's stored in a class named Constants.java in the root code folder. And it should look like this:

```java
package com.gmail.at.boban.talevski.stormy18;

public class Constants {

    public static final String API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE;
}
```
